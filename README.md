## Next steps
+ OOP
    - state are an extension of components
    - Singleton class concepts

+ Optimize poll loops like libuv
+ Picodom JS template library
+ Gulp inject for serving and testing in browser to develop interfaces

# To compile on windows:
tdm-gcc 64  
advice: git bash
# To compile on linux (ubuntu tested):
build-essentials (make, g++)
webkit-gtk

for mor platform see github

## Steps:

No nodejs?
.tmp is a swap of last compiled assets
gulp fake tools based on platform under tools/ could be used as aliases
Directory personalizzate da www/.bundle devono essere specificate negli script
